web-management
==============
This is the Joomla! empty web site used in the first installation of the Master machine.
The project choose to use the GitHub as a "distribution" approach instead of leaving the user install Joomla! and the componet to ease the burden installation.
With this approach is possible to clone the project, import the DB (operation done automatically by the installer) and have the web site ready to use.
